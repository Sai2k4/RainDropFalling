# Falling Rain Simulation

This project demonstrates a dynamic "falling rain" effect using a grid-based design in React.js. The rain drops appear in random colors and positions, creating a visually pleasing animation.

## Features
- **Dynamic Rain Effect**: A grid-based layout where rain drops fall dynamically.
- **Random Colors**: Each drop is assigned a random color from a predefined palette.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid can scale to fill the entire screen.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Easily adjust the grid size by modifying the component properties.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Frontend framework used for creating the interactive UI.
- **CSS**: For styling and grid layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for dynamic rain effect and grid rendering.
